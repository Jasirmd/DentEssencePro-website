2. What is dental cleaning or scaling?
Patient Education by DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore
Dental cleaning, also known as scaling and polishing, is a professional procedure performed by a dentist or dental hygienist to remove plaque, tartar (calculus), and surface stains from your teeth.

At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic in Tatanagar, Bangalore, we use ultrasonic scalers for a safe, painless, and thorough cleaning experience.

? Why Is Dental Cleaning Important?
Even with daily brushing and flossing, plaque hardens into tartar, especially near the gumline and between teeth. If not removed, this can lead to:

Gum disease (gingivitis or periodontitis)
Bad breath
Tooth sensitivity or decay
Yellowing or staining of teeth
✅ What Happens During Scaling & Polishing?
Ultrasonic scaling to gently remove tartar and plaque
Manual scaling for areas needing fine cleaning
Polishing to smooth the enamel and remove stains
Fluoride rinse (optional) for added protection
?️ How to explain to a patient:
“Dental cleaning is like a service for your teeth—it removes the dirt and buildup you can’t reach with a brush, keeping your mouth fresh and your gums healthy.”

3. Why is professional cleaning necessary?
Preventive Care by DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore
Professional teeth cleaning (scaling and polishing) is essential for maintaining healthy gums, fresh breath, and cavity-free teeth. Even with regular brushing and flossing at home, certain areas of your mouth are hard to reach—this is where professional cleaning becomes crucial.

At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic in Tatanagar, Bangalore, we recommend a cleaning every 6 months to keep your smile bright and your gums healthy.

? Reasons Why Professional Cleaning Is Necessary:
1. Removes Tartar (Hardened Plaque):
Brushing can’t remove tartar (calculus) that builds up over time. It needs to be professionally scaled off.

2. Prevents Gum Disease:
Tartar leads to gingivitis and periodontitis, causing bleeding gums, bad breath, and even tooth loss if untreated.

3. Improves Breath:
Professional cleaning clears bacteria and debris trapped around gums, eliminating bad breath (halitosis).

4. Prevents Tooth Decay:
Clean teeth are less likely to develop cavities, saving you from more complex treatments.

5. Keeps Teeth Looking Bright:
Scaling removes surface stains caused by coffee, tea, smoking, and certain foods.

?️ How to explain to a patient:
“Even the best brushing can’t remove tartar. A dental cleaning is like a deep cleanse—it keeps your teeth and gums safe from future problems.”

6. Will teeth become loose after cleaning?
Expert Clarification from DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore
No, teeth do not become loose because of cleaning.
In fact, professional dental cleaning (scaling) helps prevent the gum disease that actually causes teeth to loosen over time.

At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic in Tatanagar, Bangalore, we ensure that your teeth are cleaned safely and gently—with a focus on protecting gum and bone health.

✅ Why This Myth Exists:
If a patient already has gum disease or bone loss, teeth may already be loose. After cleaning:

Tartar covering the looseness is removed, which makes the movement noticeable
Gums shrink slightly as inflammation reduces, revealing the real condition
? What Actually Happens:
Cleaning removes harmful bacteria and deposits
Gums tighten over time with healing
Bone support improves when infection is controlled
?️ How to explain to a patient:
“Teeth don’t become loose because of cleaning. If they feel loose, it’s because of gum issues that cleaning helps fix—not cause.”
