22. why do my gums bleed when I brush?

Answer:
Bleeding gums during brushing is often an early sign of gum disease (gingivitis) — caused by plaque buildup along the gum line. It may also result from brushing too hard, using a hard-bristled toothbrush, or having poor oral hygiene.

? Other Common Causes:

Gum infections or inflammation
Vitamin C or K deficiencies
Hormonal changes (pregnancy, puberty)
Certain medications (e.g., blood thinners)
Ill-fitting dental restorations or dentures

Why Gum Health Matters

Healthy gums are the foundation of a healthy smile. Gum disease (gingivitis and periodontitis) not only causes bleeding gums and bad breath but can also lead to bone loss, loose teeth, and even systemic health issues such as diabetes and heart disease.

Regular scaling and polishing are great for basic cleaning, but when gum disease has progressed, laser-assisted deep cleaning and root planing provide a much more effective and long-lasting solution.

What Is Laser-Assisted Teeth Cleaning & Periodontal Therapy?

Unlike conventional cleaning, laser therapy uses advanced dental lasers to target and remove bacteria, diseased tissue, and hardened tartar (calculus) deep below the gumline.

The process typically involves:

Scaling: Removing plaque and tartar from tooth surfaces.

Root Planing: Smoothing the root surfaces to prevent future bacterial buildup.

Laser Disinfection: Killing bacteria and promoting healing without invasive surgery.

Yes. Laser-assisted periodontal therapy is not just a cleaning procedure—it’s an investment in saving your teeth and improving your overall health. Treating gum disease early prevents tooth loss and reduces the need for expensive surgeries or implants later.

If you notice bleeding gums, persistent bad breath, or loose teeth, don’t delay. Early intervention with laser-assisted deep cleaning can save your smile.
