1. First Orthodontic Check-up by Age 7

“According to the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO), every child should have their first orthodontic check-up by the age of 7. By this age, permanent teeth have started to appear, and we can identify early signs of crowding, bite issues, or jaw growth problems.

An early orthodontic evaluation does not always mean immediate treatment. In many cases, it helps us monitor growth and guide teeth into better positions naturally, reducing the need for complex treatments later. If early intervention is needed, simple appliances or braces can make a big difference in a child’s smile and confidence.

At DentEssencePRO, we specialize in child-friendly orthodontic care in Bangalore, ensuring kids feel comfortable and parents are well-informed. Early orthodontic care is the key to a healthier, more beautiful smile that lasts a lifetime.”

2. Can I eat normally with braces?

Do Braces Hurt?

When first applied: You may feel tightness or pressure as the brackets and wires begin moving your teeth.

During adjustments: Every time the orthodontist changes or tightens the wire, there can be some tenderness for 2–3 days.

Normal soreness: Feels like dull pressure or mild toothache, not sharp pain.

⏳ How Long Does It Last?

Usually 2–4 days after fitting or adjustments.

Your mouth adjusts quickly, and most patients forget they even have braces after the first week.

? How to Relieve Discomfort

Soft foods: soups, yogurt, pasta, rice.

Warm salt water rinses: soothe gums and cheeks.

Orthodontic wax: prevents brackets from irritating lips/cheeks.

Mild pain relievers (if prescribed by your dentist).

 In short: Braces don’t constantly hurt. You only feel temporary soreness when they’re applied or adjusted, and it usually eases within a few days

--------------------------------------------------------

3. Will my speech change with braces?

Yes, braces can temporarily affect speech, but usually only in the beginning. Here’s what you need to know:

Why Speech Changes

Tongue Adjustment: Braces take up space inside your mouth, so your tongue may need time to adjust its movement when forming sounds.

Pronunciation: Certain sounds, especially “s,” “sh,” “ch,” “th”, may feel a little awkward or cause a slight lisp.

Saliva Flow: Braces can increase saliva initially, which may also affect clarity of speech.

How Long It Lasts

Most people notice changes only in the first few days to weeks after getting braces.

Your speech typically returns to normal once your mouth adapts.

Tips to Improve Speech with Braces

Practice speaking (read aloud, sing, or talk more often).

Slow down your speech until you feel comfortable.

Stay hydrated to reduce excess saliva.

Wax on braces can reduce irritation that sometimes affects pronunciation.

Speech changes are temporary and improve quickly as your tongue and lips adapt.

-------------------------------------------------------

4. Are braces expensive?

Yes — braces can be expensive, but how much you’ll pay depends on many factors. Here’s a breakdown of what influences cost, and typical ranges in India to give you an idea.

⚙️ What Affects the Cost

Type of Braces / Alignment System

Traditional metal braces are usually the least costly.

Ceramic (tooth-colored) braces cost more because of material.

Invisible aligners (clear trays) tend to be pricier.

Complexity of the Case

How crooked the teeth are.

Whether there’s a bite issue (overbite, underbite, crossbite).

Additional work needed (extracting teeth, jaw expanders, etc.).

Duration of Treatment

More time = more check-ups, adjustments, perhaps more materials.

Clinic Location & Dentist Expertise

Big cities / premium clinics cost more.

An experienced orthodontist may charge higher fees.

Follow-Up Costs

Retainers after braces.

Visits for adjustments.

Possibility of repairs (if wires/bands break).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

5. What happens after braces are removed?

Great question. Removing braces is an exciting milestone, but treatment isn’t completely over when the brackets come off. Here’s what typically happens:

Immediately After Braces Removal

Polishing & Cleaning: Your orthodontist removes glue/resin and polishes teeth.

Teeth May Feel Strange: They’ll feel smooth, and your bite will feel different at first.

Slight Sensitivity: Some patients experience mild tenderness or gum soreness.

Retainers Are Given

Purpose: Teeth have a natural tendency to shift back (relapse).

Types:

Removable clear retainers (look like aligners).

Fixed wire retainers (bonded behind front teeth).

Duration: Usually worn full-time for a few months, then nightly. Some need long-term/nightly wear.

Oral Care & Lifestyle

Teeth Whitening Option: Some patients opt for whitening after braces for a brighter smile.

Good Hygiene: Brushing, flossing, and dental cleanings remain essential.

Diet Freedom: You can enjoy crunchy, sticky foods again (but keep moderation for dental health).

Follow-Ups

Orthodontist will schedule check-ups to ensure teeth are stable.

Retainers are checked and replaced if worn out.

✅ In short: After braces are removed, your teeth look straight and clean, but wearing your retainers is crucial to keep them that way.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. What types of braces are available?

Types of Braces
1. Metal Braces (Traditional)

Made of stainless steel brackets and wires.

Most common and affordable.

Very effective, especially for complex cases.

2. Ceramic Braces

Tooth-colored or clear brackets that blend with teeth.

Less noticeable than metal braces.

Slightly more expensive and delicate.

3. Lingual Braces

Attached to the back (tongue side) of the teeth.

Invisible from the outside.

May affect speech initially and cost more.

4. Self-Ligating Braces

Similar to metal/ceramic braces, but use clips instead of elastic bands.

Faster adjustments, less pressure, more comfort.

Available in metal or ceramic.

5. Clear Aligners (Invisible Braces)

Removable, transparent trays (like Invisalign).

Nearly invisible and comfortable.

Best for mild to moderate corrections.

Require discipline (20–22 hours/day wear).

✅ Key Takeaway for Patients:

All types can straighten teeth effectively.

Choice depends on budget, aesthetics, and treatment complexity.

Orthodontist will guide the best option.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

7. How often are follow-up visits required?
How Often Are Visits Needed?

First few months: Usually every 4–6 weeks.

During active treatment: Standard check-ups are once a month (to tighten wires, change elastics, check progress).

With self-ligating braces or clear aligners: Visits may be less frequent, about every 6–8 weeks.

If there’s an issue: Extra visits may be needed if a bracket breaks, wire pokes, or teeth aren’t tracking properly.

?‍⚕️ Why Regular Visits Are Important

Adjust wires/elastics to keep teeth moving in the right direction.

Monitor oral hygiene and prevent problems like cavities or gum issues.

Replace broken brackets or fix wire irritation.

Track progress and make changes to the treatment plan.

 Take away for Patients

Most patients need monthly visits.

Skipping visits can delay treatment and sometimes cause teeth to shift incorrectly.

Even with clear aligners, you must check in to ensure progress matches the digital plan.

------------------------------------------------------------

8. How should I take care of my teeth with braces?

Daily Oral Care with Braces

1. Brushing

Brush after every meal (not just twice daily).

Use a soft-bristle toothbrush or an orthodontic brush with a V-shape.

Hold the brush at a 45° angle to clean around brackets and wires.

Spend at least 2–3 minutes brushing.

2. Flossing

Use floss threaders or orthodontic floss to clean between teeth.

Interdental brushes or water flossers make it easier to reach under wires.

3. Mouth Rinse

Use a fluoride mouthwash daily to protect against cavities and white spots.

Warm salt water rinses can soothe gum irritation.

? Eating Habits

Eat soft foods: rice, pasta, cooked veggies, bananas, yogurt.

 Avoid hard & sticky foods: nuts, popcorn, chewing gum, caramel, ice cubes.

Cut fruits/veggies (like apples, carrots) into small bite-size pieces instead of biting directly.

Comfort & Protection

Apply orthodontic wax on brackets if they irritate lips/cheeks.

Wear a mouthguard during sports to protect braces and teeth.

⚕️ Regular Check-ups

Visit your orthodontist every 4–6 weeks (or as advised).

Report issues immediately (broken brackets, poking wires).
With braces, your teeth need extra care — brush after meals, floss carefully, avoid hard/sticky foods, and keep up with regular orthodontic visits. This ensures healthy teeth and the best results after braces are removed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. What are orthodontic braces?
“Orthodontic braces are modern dental devices used to straighten crooked teeth, close gaps, and correct bite problems such as overbite, underbite, and crossbite. They work by applying gentle, controlled pressure to gradually move your teeth and jaws into proper alignment.

Today’s orthodontics goes beyond just metal braces. At DentEssencePRO, we offer a range of advanced solutions including ceramic tooth-colored braces, lingual braces placed behind the teeth, and nearly invisible clear aligners (Invisalign alternatives in Bangalore) – ensuring treatment that is both effective and esthetically pleasing.

Choosing braces is not only about achieving a beautiful smile makeover. It also helps improve oral hygiene, reduces the risk of gum disease and cavities, and enhances bite function for long-term dental health.

At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Tatanagar, Bangalore, we are committed to providing affordable braces treatment in Bangalore with flexible EMI options, world-class technology, and a personalized approach for every patient. Whether you are a teenager or an adult, you can experience the care of the best orthodontist in Bangalore for a confident and radiant smile.”

10. Who needs braces?

“Braces are recommended for anyone who wants to improve the alignment of their teeth and bite. You may need orthodontic braces if you have:

Crowded or crooked teeth that overlap or don’t fit properly

Gaps or spaces between teeth

Overbite or deep bite (upper teeth excessively covering the lower teeth)

Underbite (lower teeth protruding ahead of the upper teeth)

Crossbite (upper teeth biting inside the lower teeth)

Open bite (space between upper and lower teeth when the mouth is closed)

Jaw alignment problems that affect chewing, speech, or facial profile

Braces are not just for children and teenagers – adults too can achieve a perfect smile with modern orthodontic treatments like ceramic braces, lingual braces, and clear aligners (Invisalign alternatives in Bangalore).

Correcting these issues with braces does more than improve your smile’s appearance. It also makes teeth easier to clean, reduces the risk of cavities and gum disease, and improves bite efficiency, protecting your teeth in the long term.

At DentEssencePRO, we specialize in providing affordable orthodontic treatment in Bangalore with personalized care, flexible EMI options, and the expertise of one of the best orthodontists in Bangalore, Prof. Dr. Sowmya Gangaiah.”

11. At what age can braces be started?
“Orthodontic braces can be started once a child’s permanent teeth begin to erupt – usually between the ages of 10 to 14 years. This is the ideal time because the teeth and jaw are still developing, making it easier to guide them into proper alignment. Early orthodontic evaluation (around age 7) helps us identify potential bite or alignment issues and plan the best time to begin treatment.

However, braces are not limited to children or teenagers. Many adults also choose orthodontic treatment to correct crooked teeth, gaps, or bite problems. With options such as ceramic braces, lingual braces, and clear aligners (Invisalign alternatives in Bangalore), adults can achieve a confident smile discreetly and comfortably.

At DentEssencePRO, we believe it’s never too late to improve your smile. Whether you’re a teenager or an adult, our team provides affordable braces treatment in Bangalore with flexible EMI options, world-class technology, and the expertise of one of the best orthodontists in Bangalore.”

12. How long does the treatment take?

The duration of orthodontic treatment with braces varies from person to person, depending on the severity of misalignment, type of braces, and how well the patient follows instructions. On average, most treatments last between 12 to 24 months.

Some minor corrections can be completed in less than a year, while more complex cases may take slightly longer. With modern techniques like self-ligating braces, ceramic braces, and clear aligners (Invisalign alternatives in Bangalore), treatment is faster, more comfortable, and more esthetic than ever before.

At DentEssencePRO, we use digital orthodontic planning and advanced monitoring tools to ensure efficient results and minimize treatment time. Every smile is unique, so we provide a customized treatment plan with a clear timeline during your consultation.

With the expertise of one of the best orthodontists in Bangalore, you can be assured of a beautiful, healthy smile in the shortest possible time – and with flexible EMI options, braces treatment is also affordable and accessible.”
