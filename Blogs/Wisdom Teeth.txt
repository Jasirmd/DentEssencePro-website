1. What are wisdom teeth?

Dental Insights from DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore
Wisdom teeth are the third and final set of molars that usually appear between the ages of 17 and 25. Most people have four wisdom teeth—one in each corner of the mouth (upper and lower jaws).

They are called "wisdom" teeth because they erupt at a more mature age—when a person is “wiser.”

✅ Key Facts About Wisdom Teeth:
They are located at the very back of your mouth
They often don’t have enough space to erupt properly
Some people have fewer than four or none at all
In many cases, they become impacted (trapped under the gum or jawbone)
⚠️ Why Are Wisdom Teeth Problematic?
Wisdom teeth may:

Erupt crooked or sideways
Cause crowding or pain
Lead to infections, gum swelling, or cysts
Be difficult to clean, increasing the risk of decay

3. Why do wisdom teeth cause problems?

Wisdom teeth often cause problems because they don’t have enough space to erupt properly. They are the last set of molars to emerge, usually between ages 17 and 25, when the jaw is already fully developed.

At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic in Tatanagar, Bangalore, we regularly treat patients with impacted or misaligned wisdom teeth that lead to pain, infection, and crowding.

? Common Reasons Wisdom Teeth Cause Issues:
1. Lack of Space in the Jaw
Most jaws don’t have room to accommodate a third molar
This causes teeth to erupt crooked, sideways, or stuck under the gum
2. Impaction
The tooth is trapped in the bone or gum
Can lead to pain, swelling, and infection
3. Partial Eruption
Partially emerged teeth create flaps in the gums
Food and bacteria get trapped, causing pericoronitis (gum infection)
4. Damage to Nearby Teeth
Wisdom teeth can push against adjacent molars, leading to:
Pain
Decay in the second molar
Tooth movement or crowding
5. Cyst Formation
Impacted wisdom teeth can form fluid-filled cysts that damage bone or roots
?️ How to explain to a patient:
“Wisdom teeth are like the last guests arriving at a full party—there’s often no space left, so they push, get stuck, or create trouble.”
