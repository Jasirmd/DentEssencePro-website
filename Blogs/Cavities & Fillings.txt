1. GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement) Filling Cost in Bangalore

What Are GIC Fillings?

GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement) fillings are a tooth-colored restorative material commonly used to fill cavities, especially in children and patients with high decay risk. Unlike silver (amalgam) fillings, GIC blends naturally with your teeth and releases fluoride, helping prevent further decay.

When Are GIC Fillings Recommended?

Dentists may suggest GIC fillings in the following cases:

Cavities in milk teeth (children’s primary teeth)

Small cavities in permanent teeth

As a temporary filling before a permanent restoration

In areas where fluoride release is beneficial (patients with high caries risk)

For non-load-bearing teeth (not subjected to heavy chewing forces)
