1. What is a root canal?

— Explained by Experts at DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore
Root canal treatment (RCT) is a common dental procedure to treat infected, damaged, or decayed teeth without extraction. At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic in Tatanagar, Bangalore, we use advanced techniques and painless methods to save your natural teeth and relieve dental pain.

✅ Why Do You Need Root Canal Treatment?
You may need an RCT if you're experiencing:

Severe tooth pain or sensitivity
Swelling around the gums
A cracked, broken, or decayed tooth
Darkening of the tooth
Root canal therapy is essential to prevent tooth loss and avoid infection spreading to nearby teeth or bone.

How is Root Canal Treatment Done?
At DentEssencePRO, our experienced dentists follow a safe, 5-step process:

Local anesthesia to make the procedure painless
Removal of infected or damaged pulp
Cleaning and shaping of root canals
Filling and sealing the canals

2. Root Canal Treatment Cost in Bangalore (DentEssencePRO)

At DentEssencePRO, we believe in transparent pricing so that patients know exactly what to expect. The cost of RCT depends on the type of tooth treated:

First Molars ₹5,000
Second Molars ₹6,000
Third Molars (Wisdom Teeth) ₹8,000
What Affects the Cost of RCT?

3. How do I know if I need a root canal?

If you're experiencing persistent tooth pain or swelling, it could be more than just a cavity. You may need a root canal treatment — a procedure that saves your natural tooth by removing infected pulp.

At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic in Bangalore, common signs that you may need a root canal include:

✅ Severe, lingering toothache, especially with pressure or chewing
✅ Sensitivity to hot or cold that lingers after the stimulus is removed
✅ Swollen, tender gums near the affected tooth
✅ Discolored or darkened tooth
✅ Pimple-like bump on the gum (abscess)
✅ Bad taste or odor from the tooth

Ignoring these symptoms can lead to infection or tooth loss. At DentEssencePRO, we use advanced, painless root canal techniques, often in a single sitting.

5. How do I know if I need a root canal?

Signs You Might Need Root Canal Treatment | DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore
You may need a root canal treatment when the soft tissue inside your tooth (called the pulp) becomes infected, inflamed, or damaged. This can happen due to deep decay, trauma, or cracks.

⚠️ Common Signs You Might Need a Root Canal:
Severe toothache when chewing or biting
Lingering sensitivity to hot or cold (even after the stimulus is removed)
Swollen or tender gums around the tooth
Darkening or discoloration of the tooth
Pimple or abscess on the gum
Cracked, broken, or injured tooth
Deep cavity or decay reaching the tooth's nerve
Why Early Diagnosis Matters:
Delaying treatment can lead to:

8. Is a crown required after a root canal?
 Expert Guidance by DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore
Yes, in most cases, a crown is strongly recommended after a root canal treatment—especially for back teeth (molars and premolars) that bear heavy chewing forces.

At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic in Tatanagar, Bangalore, we help you choose the right crown to protect your treated tooth and ensure long-term success.

✅ Why is a Crown Needed After RCT?
To protect the tooth from cracking or breaking (RCT-treated teeth become brittle)
To restore full chewing function
To seal the tooth completely and prevent reinfection
To improve aesthetics, especially if the tooth is discolored
? When a Crown May Not Be Needed:
Front teeth (incisors and canines) with low bite force may sometimes be restored with a filling or composite build-up—depending on the case.
How to explain to a patient:
“After a root canal, the tooth becomes hollow and weak—like a shell. A crown acts like a helmet, protecting it from cracking and helping it last longer.”
At DentEssencePRO, We Offer:
Metal-ceramic, Zirconia, and E-max crowns
Same-day or next-day crown appointments
Digital shade matching for natural-looking results
Long-lasting, durable restorations with proper bite alignment

Trusted Care from DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore
A root canal-treated tooth can last a lifetime with proper care and restoration. At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic in Tatanagar, Bangalore, we ensure every root canal is done with precision and sealed effectively to give you long-term results.

✅ Lifespan of a Root Canal-Treated Tooth:
With a crown: 15 to 25+ years or more

With regular care: Some RCT-treated teeth can last a lifetime
? What Helps a Root Canal Tooth Last Long?
Proper restoration with a crown or filling
Excellent oral hygiene (brushing, flossing, rinsing)
Avoiding hard foods (ice, nuts, biting pens)
Regular dental check-ups every 6 months
No teeth grinding (wear a nightguard if advised)
How to explain to a patient:

10. Are there alternatives to root canal treatment?

Honest Answers from DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore
Yes, there are alternatives to root canal treatment—but they often involve removing the tooth, which can lead to more complex and costly procedures later.

At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic in Tatanagar, Bangalore, we always aim to preserve your natural teeth whenever possible.

✅ Main Alternative to Root Canal:
❌ Tooth Extraction
If you don’t undergo root canal treatment, the infected or damaged tooth may need to be removed. But tooth loss can affect chewing, appearance, and nearby teeth.

What Comes After Extraction?
Dental Implant:
Most ideal replacement
Strong, natural-looking, but costlier
Involves minor surgery and healing time
Dental Bridge:
Fixed replacement
Requires trimming of adjacent healthy teeth
Removable Denture:
Budget-friendly
Less stable, may affect speech and comfort
“We always try to save your natural tooth first. An implant is a great backup, but preserving your real tooth with a root canal is often the best, most cost-effective option.”
Why Root Canal Is Often Better:
Preserves your natural bite and smile
No need to alter neighboring teeth
Lower cost compared to implants or bridges
Quicker recovery, no surgery involved
