1. How to Care for Your Dentures

Dentures are a reliable solution for replacing missing teeth, helping you restore both your smile and confidence. However, just like natural teeth, dentures require proper care to stay clean, comfortable, and long-lasting. At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic in Bangalore, we guide our patients through simple steps to keep dentures in excellent condition.

Daily Denture Care Tips
1. Clean Your Dentures Properly

Rinse dentures after every meal to remove food particles.

Use a soft-bristled brush and a non-abrasive denture cleanser (never regular toothpaste, which can scratch the surface).

Gently brush your gums, tongue, and any remaining natural teeth before putting your dentures back in.

2. Handle with Care

Always clean dentures over a towel or a bowl of water to avoid breakage if dropped.

Avoid bending or damaging the clasps and plastic base.

3. Keep Them Moist

Dentures can lose their shape if they dry out. When not in use, place them in plain water or denture-soaking solution.

Never use hot water, as it may warp your dentures.

4. Eat and Speak with Confidence

Start with soft foods cut into small pieces until you adjust.

Chew slowly and evenly on both sides of your mouth.

Practice reading aloud to improve speech clarity and reduce any lisp.

5. Visit Your Dentist Regularly

Routine check-ups at DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic Bangalore ensure your dentures fit well.

Poorly fitting dentures can cause gum irritation, mouth sores, or even bone loss.

If you notice clicking, looseness, or discomfort — consult your dentist immediately.

What to Avoid with Dentures

❌ Don’t use bleach or harsh cleaners — they can damage the material.
❌ Don’t sleep with dentures unless your dentist advises.
❌ Don’t ignore persistent pain, bad breath, or sores — these may signal an infection or poor fit.
