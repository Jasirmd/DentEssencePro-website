    review: "Went for a dental check up to this clinic. It's a very hygienic place with very professional doctors. I ended with getting a wart removed which was hurting me since long. This was possible because they have very high end equipment in place and thanks a lot dr makam gangaiah sir for discussing all the problems giving amazing solutions."
