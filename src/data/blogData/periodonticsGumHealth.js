    content: `//Why Gum Health Matters//

Healthy gums are the foundation of a healthy smile. Gum disease (gingivitis and periodontitis) not only causes bleeding gums and bad breath but can also lead to bone loss, loose teeth, and even systemic health issues such as diabetes and heart disease.

Regular scaling and polishing are great for basic cleaning, but when gum disease has progressed, laser-assisted deep cleaning and root planing provide a much more effective and long-lasting solution.

||What Is Laser-Assisted Teeth Cleaning & Periodontal Therapy?||

Unlike conventional cleaning, laser therapy uses advanced dental lasers to target and remove bacteria, diseased tissue, and hardened tartar (calculus) deep below the gumline.

The process typically involves:

- Scaling: Removing plaque and tartar from tooth surfaces
- Root Planing: Smoothing the root surfaces to prevent future bacterial buildup
- Laser Disinfection: Killing bacteria and promoting healing without invasive surgery

//Cost of Laser-Assisted Deep Cleaning in Bangalore//

At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore, we offer transparent and affordable pricing for periodontal therapy.

💎 Cost: ₹6,000 per quadrant

Since the mouth is divided into four quadrants (upper right, upper left, lower right, lower left), the total cost depends on the number of quadrants requiring treatment.

Treatment | Cost
Laser-Assisted Teeth Cleaning & Root Planing (Per Quadrant) | ₹6,000
Full Mouth (All 4 Quadrants) | ₹24,000

||Benefits of Laser-Assisted Gum Treatment||

✅ Minimally invasive – Less pain, no stitches
✅ Faster healing compared to traditional surgery
✅ Reduces infection risk by sterilizing the area
✅ Preserves gum tissue and promotes regeneration
✅ Comfortable & precise treatment with minimal bleeding

||Is It Worth the Investment?||

Yes. Laser-assisted periodontal therapy is not just a cleaning procedure—it's an investment in saving your teeth and improving your overall health. Treating gum disease early prevents tooth loss and reduces the need for expensive surgeries or implants later.

⚠️ If you notice bleeding gums, persistent bad breath, or loose teeth, don't delay. Early intervention with laser-assisted deep cleaning can save your smile.`
