    content: `||What is the correct way to brush my teeth?||

Oral hygiene advice by DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore. Brushing your teeth the right way helps prevent cavities, gum disease, and bad breath. We recommend the Modified Bass Technique for effective and gentle cleaning.

//Step-by-step guide to proper brushing//

✅ Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
- Choose soft or ultra-soft to avoid gum damage
- Replace your toothbrush every 3 months

✅ Use fluoride toothpaste
- Fluoride strengthens enamel and prevents decay

✅ Position the brush at a 45 degree angle to the gumline
- This helps clean the margin where plaque collects

✅ Use gentle circular or vibratory motions
- Avoid aggressive scrubbing
- Brush each tooth section for about 5 to 10 seconds

✅ Cover all tooth surfaces
- Outer, inner, and chewing surfaces

✅ Do not forget the tongue
- Gently brush or scrape to reduce bacteria and bad breath

✅ Brush for 2 full minutes
- 30 seconds per quadrant
- Use a timer or an electric brush with a built-in timer

💡 "Imagine brushing as massaging your teeth and gums, not scrubbing. The right technique keeps teeth clean and gums healthy without causing damage."

    content: `||How often should I brush?||

You should brush your teeth twice a day: once in the morning after breakfast and once at night before bed. Consistency and correct technique are key.

//Best times to brush//

- Morning: removes plaque that built up overnight
- Night: cleans away food, plaque, and bacteria from the day

//Should I brush more than twice a day?//

- Consider an extra gentle brush if you ate sticky, sugary, or acidic foods
- Consider extra brushing with braces or if advised by your dentist
- Avoid overbrushing or brushing too hard

💡 "Brushing twice a day is like cleaning your room daily. Start fresh in the morning and keep it clean at night."

Brush for a full 2 minutes every time. Follow the 2-minute rule using the correct technique for best results.

//Brushing time breakdown//

- Divide your mouth into 4 quadrants
- Spend 30 seconds per quadrant
- Cover outer, inner, and chewing surfaces

//Tools to help you brush for 2 minutes//

- Electric toothbrush with timer
- A 2-minute song or phone timer
- Brushing apps for kids and adults

    excerpt: 'Use a soft-bristled brush with a small to medium head. Replace every 3 months.',
    content: `||What type of toothbrush should I use?||

Choosing the right toothbrush is crucial. Soft bristles are gentle yet effective for plaque removal.

//Best toothbrush features//

- Soft bristles: gentle on enamel and gums
- Small to medium head: easier to reach back teeth
- Comfortable non-slip handle: better control

//Manual vs electric toothbrush//

Feature | Manual | Electric
Cost | Low | Higher initial cost
Ease | Technique dependent | Built-in timers help
Effectiveness | Effective with good technique | More effective for plaque removal for many users
Portability | Very portable | Less portable

✅ Both are effective when used correctly.

//When to change your brush//

- Every 3 months
- After an illness
- When bristles are frayed or bent

💡 "Soft bristles clean well and protect gums. If brushing feels harsh, change your brush, not your pressure."`

Most people should use a fluoride toothpaste to help prevent cavities and strengthen enamel.

Concern | Recommended type
Cavities | Fluoride toothpaste
Sensitivity | Desensitizing toothpaste
Gum problems | Antibacterial toothpaste
Bad breath | Toothpaste with zinc or chlorhexidine
Whitening | Mild whitening with silica (avoid harsh abrasives)
Kids | Mild, low-fluoride options as advised

✅ Avoid harsh abrasives or charcoal unless advised by your dentist.`

    content: `||Can brushing too hard damage my teeth?||

Yes. Brushing too hard can harm your teeth and gums.

//What can happen if you brush too hard//

- Gum recession exposes sensitive roots
- Enamel wear leads to sensitivity
- Abrasion notches at the gum line

//How to brush safely//

- Use a soft-bristled brush
- Hold your brush like a pen
- Apply gentle pressure with small circular motions
- Brush for 2 minutes, twice a day

    content: `||Do I still need to floss if I brush well?||

Yes. Brushing alone misses tight spaces between teeth and below the gumline.

//Why flossing matters//

- Removes plaque between teeth
- Prevents gum disease and bad breath
- Protects crowns, bridges, veneers, and implants

//Flossing options//

- String floss (waxed or unwaxed)
- Floss picks

    content: `||Should I brush after every meal?||

Not necessarily. Brushing immediately after acidic meals can harm enamel.

//Ideal brushing routine//

- Twice a day is enough for most people
- Morning after breakfast; night before bed (most important)

//When not to brush immediately//

- After acidic foods and drinks: citrus, sodas, fruit juices, vinegar-based foods
- Wait at least 30 minutes to avoid enamel erosion

//What to do after meals//

- Rinse with water
- Chew sugar-free gum
- Use a non-alcoholic mouthwash if needed

💡 "If the surface is softened by acid, brushing too soon can scratch it. Rinse and brush later."`

Flossing uses a thin thread to clean between teeth and under the gumline where your toothbrush cannot reach.

//Step-by-step flossing//

- Break off 12 to 18 inches of floss
- Wind most around middle fingers; hold taut with thumbs and index fingers
- Slide gently between teeth; do not snap
- Curve into a C-shape around each tooth
- Slide up and down under the gumline
- Use a clean section for each space
- Do not forget the back teeth

Pro tips:
- Floss once daily, preferably at night
- If gums bleed, keep flossing gently. Bleeding reduces as gums get healthier
- Use floss picks or a water flosser if string floss is difficult`

A water flosser uses a pressurized stream of pulsating water to clean between teeth and below the gumline.

//How it works//

- Fill the reservoir with water (or dentist-recommended rinse)
- Use the jet tip to target plaque and debris
- Aim along the gumline and between teeth
- Water can reach below the gumline for effective cleaning

Both are effective. Choose based on your needs and comfort.

String floss best for:

- Manual plaque scraping

Water flosser best for:

- Gum inflammation or bleeding
- Limited hand strength

Recommendation:
- Use string floss daily if comfortable
