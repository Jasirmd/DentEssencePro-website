    content: `||GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement) Filling Cost in Bangalore||

//What are GIC fillings?//

GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement) fillings are a tooth-colored restorative material commonly used to fill cavities, especially in children and patients with high decay risk. Unlike silver amalgam fillings, GIC blends naturally with your teeth and releases fluoride, helping prevent further decay.

//When are GIC fillings recommended?//

Dentists may suggest GIC fillings in the following cases:

- Cavities in milk teeth (children primary teeth)
- Small cavities in permanent teeth
- As a temporary filling before a permanent restoration
- In areas where fluoride release is beneficial (patients with high caries risk)
- For non-load-bearing teeth (not subjected to heavy chewing forces)

//Cost of GIC fillings at DentEssencePRO Bangalore//

At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore, we provide affordable, high-quality GIC fillings at a transparent price:

₹1,500 per tooth

Type of Filling | Average Cost (per tooth)
