    content: `||GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement) Filling Cost in Bangalore||

//What are GIC fillings?//

GIC (Glass Ionomer Cement) fillings are a tooth-colored restorative material commonly used to fill cavities, especially in children and patients with high decay risk. Unlike silver amalgam fillings, GIC blends naturally with your teeth and releases fluoride, helping prevent further decay.

//When are GIC fillings recommended?//

Dentists may suggest GIC fillings in the following cases:

- Cavities in milk teeth (children primary teeth)
- Small cavities in permanent teeth
- As a temporary filling before a permanent restoration
- In areas where fluoride release is beneficial (patients with high caries risk)
- For non-load-bearing teeth (not subjected to heavy chewing forces)

//Cost of GIC fillings at DentEssencePRO Bangalore//

At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore, we provide affordable, high-quality GIC fillings at a transparent price:

₹1,500 per tooth

Type of Filling | Average Cost (per tooth)
GIC Filling (Glass Ionomer Cement) | ₹1,500

This cost includes consultation, cavity preparation, and placement of the GIC filling.

//Advantages of GIC fillings//

✅ Aesthetic - matches natural tooth color

If you or your child has a cavity, do not wait until it worsens. GIC fillings are affordable, safe, and effective at protecting your teeth.`

    excerpt: 'A protective dental coating applied on the chewing surfaces of back teeth to seal deep grooves and prevent cavities.',
    content: `||Pit and Fissure Sealants||

A protective dental coating applied on the chewing surfaces of back teeth (molars and premolars) to seal deep grooves and prevent cavities.

//Why Are Sealants Needed?//

The grooves (fissures) on permanent molars can be very deep and narrow, making them difficult to clean with a toothbrush. Food and bacteria get trapped leading to cavities.

Sealants act like a shield, preventing decay before it starts.

//Indications//

Pit and fissure sealants are recommended when:

✅ Newly erupted permanent molars (ages 6 to 7 and 11 to 13 years)
✅ Deep pits and fissures, even if there is no decay
✅ High caries-risk children (frequent sweets, poor brushing, weak enamel)
✅ History of multiple cavities
✅ Orthodontic patients (difficult hygiene)
✅ Early incipient enamel caries (white spot lesions) - preventive sealant or resin infiltration
✅ Children with special health-care needs
✅ Adults with deep grooves or past decay history

//Contraindications//

❌ Flat tooth surfaces or shallow grooves
❌ Visible cavities that require filling
❌ Poor moisture control during application

//Benefits//

⭐ Prevents cavities on chewing surfaces
⭐ Painless, quick, and non-invasive
⭐ Long-lasting protection (3 to 5+ years)
⭐ Saves cost and prevents drilling in future
⭐ Especially important during mixed dentition stage

//Ideal Age//

🦷 Children: 6 to 14 years (best time - as permanent molars erupt)
🦷 Can also be applied to adults when indicated

At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore, we provide professional sealant application to protect your teeth and your children teeth from cavities. This preventive treatment is quick, painless, and highly effective.

    excerpt: 'Dental composite is a tooth-coloured filling material made of resin and fine glass particles that bonds directly to the tooth.',
    content: `||Dental Composite||

Dental composite is a tooth-coloured filling material made of resin and fine glass particles. It bonds directly to the tooth and blends naturally with surrounding enamel, giving a cosmetic and strong restoration.

//When Is It Used?//

Dental composite is commonly used for:

✅ Tooth-Coloured Fillings (instead of silver metal fillings)
✅ Repairing cavities in front or back teeth
✅ Fixing chipped or broken teeth
✅ Cosmetic reshaping (closing gaps, improving shape)
✅ Replacing old worn fillings
✅ Composite Veneers or Smile Makeovers
✅ After root canal treatment (temporary or intermediate build-up before crown)
✅ Bonding exposed roots and sensitivity areas
✅ White spot or early caries resin infiltration

//Advantages//

⭐ Matches natural tooth colour (aesthetic)
⭐ Minimal drilling - preserves healthy tooth structure
⭐ Bonds strongly and supports the tooth
⭐ Versatile use in both front and back teeth
⭐ Quick, safe, and affordable
⭐ Repairable if chipped - no need to remove whole filling

//Limitations//

⚠️ Avoid biting very hard items on large composite fillings
⚠️ May stain over years (tea or coffee or smoking) but can be polished

//Longevity//

⏳ Typically lasts 5 to 10+ years, depending on size, bite forces, hygiene, and habits.

//Suitability//

Ideal for:

🦷 Children
🦷 Adults
🦷 Patients wanting natural-looking restorations
🦷 Those avoiding metal fillings

At DentEssencePRO Dental Clinic, Bangalore, we use high-quality dental composite materials to provide aesthetic, durable fillings that blend seamlessly with your natural teeth.
